4. Races

When the Player first starts up a new world, there will be 5 Races to choose from. Once a Race has been chosen, it can only be changed through certain NPCs.

Starting Races include:

Etkai (Water-based)
Qoqq (Earth-based)
Twaši (Fire-based)
Davlë (Air-based)
Kyndæ (Adaptable)

Note: The Kyndæ (singular Kynda) are the most human-like race and our attempt to have a sort of “human” in the mix.

More are coming Soon™.


5. Terrain and Structures

Terrain generation will mainly consist of a diamond-square algorithm which will then go through the coding equivalent of being rocket-strapped onto a String-based input system, as well as sliders for those who want X instead of Y.

As for whether terrain will be infinite or not, terrain will be finite, but wrap around, allowing for an Earth-like world.

Structures (Most of which will be optional) include:

Weather
Volcanoes
Forests
Mountain Ranges
Rivers, Lakes, Oceans
Tundra
Castles
Floating Castles
Caves
Plains

And more coming soon as features are discussed.


6. Mining

The plans for mining are still unfinished, however, the basic nutshell of it is:

Mining isn't required early on.

Mining will be required for higher end equipment.

You'll be able to find crystals.

Moreover, mining is not the primary focus of the game. This game is meant to be malleable, which means you can change the ground, but it's not all you do.

List of Ores*:

[Note from Newt: This world and all if its components are entirely fictional. Why not just make stuff up?]
[Note from Hawk: Shazam! We have no ores!]


(7 through 9 skipped for now)
